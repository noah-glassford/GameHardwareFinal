I chose 2 of the thumbsticks in order to aesthetically match the controller to the ghost in pacman. 
1 thumbstick and 1 button would have not been symetrical like the ghost.
I did this because many thumbsticks can be wired to function as a button and not a thumbstick.
I added many small plastic pillars to mount the thumbsticks to.
